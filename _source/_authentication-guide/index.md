# The Okta Authentication Guide

This guide answers some common questions about authentication with Okta. It is meant to be used alongside the [OAuth 2.0 API ](/docs/api/resources/oauth2.html) and the [OpenID Connect API](/docs/api/resources/oidc.html) reference documents. The reference documents will give you detailed information about endpoints and resources, while this guide will show you how to use them.

This guide will also direct you to examples of how to implement authentication in your language of choice, using one of Okta's SDKs.
