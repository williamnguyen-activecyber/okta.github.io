#### Concurrency Rate Limits

In order to protect the service for all customers, Okta enforces concurrent rate limits starting with this release.
Concurrent limits are distinct from [the org-wide, per-minute API rate limits](/docs/api/getting_started/design_principles.html#org-wide-rate-limits).

For concurrent rate limits, traffic is measured in three different areas (counts in one area aren't included in counts for the other two):

* For agent traffic, Okta measured each org's traffic and set the limit at above the highest usage in the last four weeks.
* For Office365 traffic, the limit is 70 concurrent transactions per org.
* For all other traffic including API requests, the limit is 70 concurrent transactions per org.

Okta has verified that these limits are sufficient based on current usage.

The first request to exceed the concurrent limit returns an HTTP 429 error, and the first error every sixty seconds is written to the log.
Reporting concurrent rate limits once a minute keeps log volume manageable.

Notice that instead of the typical counts for time-based rate limits, when a request exceeds the limit for concurrent requests,
`X-Rate-Limit-Limit`, `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining`, and `X-Rate-Limit_Reset` report the concurrent values instead. The reset time
is only an estimate, there's no guarantee that enough requests will have completed to go below the concurrent rate limit.

For more information, see developer documentation about [rate limit headers](/docs/api/getting_started/design_principles.html#rate-limiting). <!-- OKTA-140976, OKTA-142995 -->

#### Help Desk Admin Role Generally Available

The Help Desk Admin Role (`help_desk_admin_role`) is generally available via the [Roles API](/docs/api/resources/roles.html#role-properties). 
For information about this role, see the [in-app help](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Security/The%20Help%20Desk%20Admin%20Role.htm). <!-- OKTA-141867 -->

#### Policy API 

The Policy API enables an Administrator to perform policy and policy rule operations. The policy framework is used by Okta to control rules and settings that govern, among other things, user session lifetime, whether multi-factor authentication is required when logging in, what MFA factors may be employed, password complexity requirements, and what types of self-service operations are permitted under various circumstances. For more information, see Okta's [API Reference](/docs/api/resources/policy.html).

#### Password Policy API 

The Password Policy type controls settings that determine a user’s password length and complexity, as well as the frequency with which a password can be changed. This policy also governs the recovery operations that may be performed by the user, including change password, reset (forgot) password and self-service password unlock. For more information, see Okta's [API Reference](/docs/api/resources/policy.html#GroupPasswordPolicy),

### API Bug Fixes

Bug fixes are expected on preview orgs starting September 20, 2017, and on production orgs starting September 25, 2017.

* Claim evaluation didn't always respect the Universal Directory schema. (OKTA-137462)
* The `name` and `description` fields in OpenID Connect scopes weren't editable in the Okta user interface. (OKTA-136527)
