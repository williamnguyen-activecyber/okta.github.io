* Active Directory Password Policies now always return a `maxAgeDays` value of `0`, since this setting is unsupported by Active Directory. (OKTA-142874)
* Deleting a user failed if the user's primary and secondary emails were the same. (OKTA-142765)
* Deleting a user failed if the domain portion of the username string was too long. (OKTA-141876)
* Radius authentication flows would erroneously trigger `user.session.end` events in the log. (OKTA-138775)
* When a user signed in to Okta via IWA and without an MFA prompt, there was no sign on policy evaluation entry present in the system log. (OKTA-136545)
* User authentication attempts blocked by geographic restrictions in Adaptive MFA were logged as a successful login followed by a `Login Denied` event in the system log. (OKTA-112077)
