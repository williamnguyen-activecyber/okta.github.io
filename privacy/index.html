		<li><strong>Cookies</strong>
			<p>Okta uses cookies to make interactions with the website easy and meaningful. When a Visitor interacts with the website, Okta's servers send a cookie to the Visitor’s computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify the Visitor. They merely recognize the visitor’s Web browser. Unless the Customer chooses to identify themselves to Okta, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form, Okta has no way to associate this cookie data with the Visitor’s Personal Information.  </p>

			<p>For the website, Okta uses cookies that are session-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from the Visitor’s computer upon closing their browser software or turning off their computer. </p>
			<p>Most browsers have an option for turning off cookies, which will prevent their browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of the browser software) allowing the Visitor to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. </p>

			<p>Okta's website connects Visitors to third party services, with whom Okta partners with to provide the content. The use of cookies by our partners is not covered by Okta’s privacy statement. Okta does not have access or control over these cookies. Okta’s partners use session ID cookies to manage a user's connection to the partner's service. </p>
